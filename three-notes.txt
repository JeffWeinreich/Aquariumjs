TankController

31 Owner should either be renamed to Tanks or Index. 
37 GetTank -> GetTanks 
44 FromRoute automatically happens when you add {id} to the route.  
63 Use a full route here ~/api/tanks/{id}
76 Good call on resetting the owner.


FishController

18 Remove Route and use explicit routing.  
31 ~/tanks/{tankId}/fishes
31 Rename  Owner method to Index or Fishes
37 Explicit routes
54 no reason for async call really.  i think this was boiler plate code though.  
136 api/tanks/{tankId}/fishes/{id}

HomeController
